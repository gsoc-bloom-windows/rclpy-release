ros-crystal-rclpy (0.5.3-0bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * use test_msgs instead of std_msgs (#204 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/204>)
  * Fixes memory leaks for nested fields (#203 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/203>)
    This separates memory allocation out from convert_from_py function.
    Now it uses separate create_message function to allocate message,
    making it explicit gives better control where and how memory is
    allocated and freed.

ros-crystal-rclpy (0.5.0-0bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Changed the rclpy signal handler so that it is registered in ``rclpy_init()`` rather than in each wait. (#194 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/194>)
  * Changed the signal handler in rclpy to call the original signal handler when receiving SIGINT during a wait on a wait set. (#191 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/191>)
  * Added API for counting the number of publishers and subscribers on a topic. (#183 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/183>)
  * Updated Node interface so it can use the command line arguments and can optionally ignore global arguments. (#185 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/185>)
  * Changed the ``rclpy.spin*()`` functions to use a persistent executor. (#176 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/176>)
  * Fixed a bug related to zero-initialization. (#182 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/182>)
  * Added code to handle node names which are ``nullptr``. (#177 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/177>)
  * Refactored client class so that it can handle multiple requests. (#170 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/170>)
  * Fixed ``rclpy_init()`` so that it actually passes command line arguments to ``rcl_init()`` (#179 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/179>)
  * Changed logging to get the node's logger name from rcl. (#174 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/174>)
  * Fixed a bug where ``rclpy_take_response()`` was ignoring the sequence number. (#171 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/171>)
  * Added support for Futures and coroutines in the executor. (#166 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/166>)
  * Updated code to match API change needed to avoid accidental nullptr dereference. (#157 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/157>)
    * Signed-off-by: Ethan Gao <mailto:ethan.gao@linux.intel.com>
  * Added a sleep to workaround race condition in MultiThreadedExecutor test. (#168 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/168>)
  * Disable 1kHz timer tests on the ARM architectures. (#169 <https://github.com/ros2/rclpy/issues/169>)
    * Publish parameter events.
    Adds a parameter event publisher to rclpy nodes.
    * Increase base number of publishers for testing.
    Because every node has a parameter events publisher bump the number of
    expected publishers in a couple of cases.
    * Remove comment now that parameter services are implemented.
    * Delete NOT_SET parameters if present regardless of prior type.
    * Use ParameterMsg rather than RCLParameter for msg type name.
